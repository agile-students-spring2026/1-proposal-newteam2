MarketLens: Understanding Portfolio Risk and Market Impact

* What and Why?

1.What

MarketLens is a software system that helps people better understand their investment portfolios. Instead of focusing on trading or predicting prices, the system focuses on explaining what is happening in a portfolio and why.

Users can input a portfolio of assets and see:

where their risk is coming from,

what factors contributed to gains or losses over time, and

how major market events relate to changes in their portfolio.

2. Why

Many people invest through modern brokerage platforms, but these platforms mainly show prices and returns. They rarely explain:

how diversified a portfolio really is,

whether changes were caused by the overall market or by specific holdings, or

which external events may have affected performance.

As a result, investors often make decisions without fully understanding their exposure or the reasons behind portfolio changes. MarketLens aims to address this by providing clear, structured explanations that help users make sense of their investments and learn from past outcomes.

For Whom?

MarketLens is designed for real users who already manage or study investments, including:

Individual investors managing personal portfolios such as brokerage or retirement accounts

Early-career professionals working in or interested in finance

Finance students who want to better understand portfolio risk and performance in practice

These users already exist and regularly face the problems this system is intended to solve. Members of our team and people we know personally fall into this group and can provide feedback during development.

How? (From the User’s Perspective)

From an end-user’s point of view, the system will work as follows:

Portfolio Entry
Users enter their portfolio holdings, including asset identifiers and relative weights.

Risk and Exposure Overview
The system displays breakdowns such as sector exposure, geographic exposure, and overall concentration, helping users see where their portfolio may be vulnerable.

Performance Breakdown
Users choose a time period and see how much of the portfolio’s movement came from overall market trends, sector-level changes, or individual assets.

Market Event Context
Users can view or add notable market events, which are then connected to affected sectors or assets to provide context for observed portfolio changes.

The system is meant to support understanding and reflection, not to provide trading advice or automated decisions.

Scope

The project is appropriately sized for a team of 4–6 programmers working over one semester. The problem space is clearly defined, and the system focuses on analysis and explanation rather than real-time trading or complex financial automation.

Work can be divided across portfolio modeling, analytical logic, user interface design, and testing. At the same time, the project is complex enough to require careful design decisions and meaningful collaboration, making it a good fit for the course.

This proposal will be submitted as a Markdown document in README.md within the project repository.
